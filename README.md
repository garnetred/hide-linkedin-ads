# Hide LinkedIn Ads

## Abstract
This Chrome browser extension hides ads on LinkedIn. 

## Donate 
You can support this extension by [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/decemberthedeveloper) to help me continue to make free, user-friendly browser extensions.

## Tech Stack
This project uses vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML.

## Setup/Installation
You can clone the repo locally using `git clone`.

[This article](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked) offers detailed instructions on loading an unpacked chrome extension. You can navigate to the chrome extensions page via the puzzle piece icon in the toolbar. Enable "developer mode" on the top-right. From there, you can click "load unpacked extension" and choose the folder via the popup. You should then see the chart icon appear in the toolbar. When you click on it, you can see "Hide LinkedIn Ads."

From there, if you navigate to LinkedIn, you should no longer see any promoted posts in the news feed or any ads in the sidebar. 

## Future Changes
Eventually I hope to port all of my Chrome browser extensions to Firefox.
